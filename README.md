# Belly Button Biodiversity
## Background
Welcome to the Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard! In this assignment, you will be working with the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which delves into the fascinating world of microbes that inhabit human navels.

The dataset provides insights into the microbial diversity present in human navels, with a focus on operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Surprisingly, the data uncovers that a small subset of microbial species are prevalent in over 70% of individuals, while the remainder are comparatively rare.

## Objective
Your task is to create an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore and visualize the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. Through this dashboard, users will gain a deeper understanding of the microbial communities residing in human navels.

## Tools and Technologies
To complete this assignment, you will utilize various tools and technologies, including but not limited to:

Python
Flask
Plotly
JavaScript
HTML
CSS

## Features
The dashboard should include the following features:

Visualization of OTU distribution across different individuals.
Display of top microbial species present in each individual's navel.
Interactive charts allowing users to explore data at a granular level.
User-friendly interface with intuitive navigation.

## Instructions
To get started with the Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard, follow these steps:

Clone the repository containing the dataset and dashboard code.
Install the necessary dependencies as specified in the README file.
Run the Flask application to launch the dashboard.
Explore the interactive features to delve into the fascinating world of belly button microbes!
